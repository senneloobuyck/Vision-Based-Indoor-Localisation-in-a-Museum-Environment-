# Vision-Based Indoor Localisation in a Museum Environment

## Project Overview

This project explores **indoor localisation of museum visitors** using **computer vision techniques**.  
Instead of relying on GPS or indoor positioning hardware, the system determines a visitor’s location by **recognising paintings in video footage** and mapping them to known museum rooms.

The system was developed and evaluated using real-world data captured in the **Museum of Fine Arts (MSK) in Ghent**, and demonstrates that visual recognition combined with temporal modelling can achieve reliable indoor localisation.

- Match detected paintings with a reference database
- Infer the visitor’s current museum room
- Improve robustness using temporal context
